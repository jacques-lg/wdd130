            The territory of the Congo was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was settled in the Bantu expansion about 2,000 to 3,000 years ago.
             [7] In the west, the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to the 19th century.
              In the center and east, the empires of Mwene Muji, Luba, and Lunda ruled between the 15th and 19th centuries. 
              These kingdoms were broken up by Europeans during the colonization of the Congo Basin.
